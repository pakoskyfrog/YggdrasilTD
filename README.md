===========================================================

## 1/ What is the Yggdrasil TD project ?
It's a tower defence game. You have the magnificent Ygdrasil tree under control and you have to defend it by growing fruits that have abilities and can attack intruders.
It will be firstly a prototype that will be an entry to the LoveFest IV (date limit on the 22th feb).
This prototype will surely be ugly but playable, but all features will not be implemented du to lack of time.

## 3/ Backstory
The mighty Yggdrasil is the tree of everything, the bringer of life, the one passage to paradise and ... the source of eternal youth.
No wonder why, once its location discovered everyone wanted a piece...
You incarnate the spirit of the Yggdrasil tree, and you will control what grows where.
The tree begins small, with only a few spot to put fruits to defend yourself and will grow over time. You lose when the bark is no more and the foes can access to the core of the tree.
