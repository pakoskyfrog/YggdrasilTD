#              README : YGGDRASIL TD PROJECT
===========================================================

## 1/ What is the Yggdrasil TD project ?
It's a tower defence game. You have the magnificent Ygdrasil tree under control and you have to defend it by growing fruits that have abilities and can attack intruders.
It will be firstly a prototype that will be an entry to the LoveFest IV (date limit on the 22th feb).
This prototype will surely be ugly but playable, but all features will not be implemented du to lack of time.

## 2/ Advancement
* Nothing yet
* Apps framework
* Basic Main menu
* Basic File architecture
* The Tree can contain branches !
* Basic drawing mechanics
* Cascade effect
* The tree is growing ! (badly !)
* 2nd growing model done. Added non linear growth rates.
* Problem : the branches cover one eache other : not practical to put things on

## 3/ Backstory
The mighty Yggdrasil is the tree of everything, the bringer of life, the one passage to paradise and ... the source of eternal youth.
No wonder why, once its location discovered everyone wanted a piece...
You incarnate the spirit of the Yggdrasil tree, and you will control what grows where.
The tree begins small, with only a few spot to put fruits to defend yourself and will grow over time. You lose when the bark is no more and the foes can access to the core of the tree.

## 4/ Ideas
* Going through the four seasons and face 4 differents environments, by day and night.
* Some day or night conditions can be modified by weather (probably predefined in the game progression) like drought, thunderstorm, frost, extra windy, ...
* You can make "grow" on the branches {flowers, fruits, leaves, bugs, squirrels and shrooms}.
* The "towers" in the TD systems are these categories. Some can launch ammo, have some effects or special abilities.
* The tutorial system is progressive and come up stage by stage.
* Some stage will be mini-games that can be played independently once the game is finished once.
* Multiple language support : english and french in a first time
* The Dalai Lama is your friend and comes to visit you to sell you powers and to give you some advices.
* Photosynthetic energy is used to grow the tree, the "towers" and to supply the active towers (ammo regen, ...).

## 5/ TODO list
* Almost everything...
* Complete the list of "towers" with what they can do.
