    Leaves are great and green ! 
    And produce energy by photosynthesis...
    
    Globally leaf-attacks are less powerful than any other.
    
    Ideas :
    * Oak Standard Leaf TM : Besides its capitalism side, this leaf does its job (but not more).
                           : this leaf produces photosynthesis
    * Clover : Like he said... "Take Clover !!!" (Not even funny, bro...)
             : This clover can send its three leaves like a propeller
             : this leaf produces photosynthesis according to the number of remaining leaves
    * Four leaf clover : The dumb ones are supposed to be the luckiest, and this one is pretty lucky !
                       : Increased critical rates around him
                       : this leaf produces photosynthesis, with an occasional temp boost
    * Fern : Between dimension one and two, whatever that means.
           : Fractal spores : they can launch a spore which will subdivide by two on each impact
           : produces photosynthesis
    * Spine pine : Ultimate leaf badasses, they can survive winter !
           : produces photosynthesis
