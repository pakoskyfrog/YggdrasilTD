    Flowers smeel nice and are beautiful, i could stay there whatching them all day long.
    
    Ideas :
    * Mighty Lotus : This one is as magnificent as poisoneous...
                   : This flower delivers a cloud of poison that goes slowly to the ground. Affected by wind.
    * Eldeweiss : This is the one true winter jewel
                : Its presence slows the foes (because they're surprised to find it).
    * SunFlowers : Let them sunbath...
                 : can emmit a laser !
                 : they charge the laser with sun power, they need photosynthesis power to grow only.
